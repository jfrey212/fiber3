#3rd version of air sample entry program

#Sample class definition - a sample has count, volume, duration, fields, id
#Potentially use time objects to dynamically generate the duration
#Samples are stored in a hash - the sample ID will be the hash key to access the sample

#CRUD actions for fiber objects - create, read, update, delete
#Are these class methods?

#Locally stored sample variables can be written into a file
#Files can be loaded into the program for displaying past data
#program checks the local directory for sample files
#Display available files in a list, user selects the file
#option to look in a different directory?

#use regex to check user input

#Main program loop - user selects option, etc.

#Commands to break out of the loop - quit with save, quit without saving

#Is it possible to use Prawn gem to generate a PDF air sample log - may only be possible in Rails

#Use Git this time for version control

#Find out if there is a gem for displaying data in columns nicely
